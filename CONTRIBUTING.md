## 🌐 Mozilla Common Voice Path
You can contribute to Pashto data directly on Common Voice and connect it back to this project.

Common Voice Pashto actions:

Then contribute here by opening an issue/PR with:

- Update `docs/resource_catalog.md` with:
  - what the resource is,

  - practical applications.
