# 🏛️ Governance

## 🧭 Model
Lightweight maintainer model with transparent decision-making.

## 👥 Roles
- **Maintainers**: review/merge PRs, release planning, quality control.
- **Contributors**: submit code/data/docs, review, and improve workflows.
- **Community moderators**: keep discussion spaces healthy and productive.

## 🗳️ Decision process
- Default: consensus in issues/PR discussion.
- If blocked: maintainer vote with rationale posted publicly.
- Major changes: RFC issue with at least 7 days for feedback.

## 📦 Release ownership
- Each release has one responsible maintainer and one backup reviewer.

## ⚖️ Conflict resolution
- Follow [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Report issues privately to maintainers when needed.
