# GitHub Operations Guide

This guide covers repository operations that can be versioned in code and manual steps that must be done in the GitHub web UI.

## In-Repo Operations (Versioned)

- Issue templates: [../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
- PR template: [../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- CI workflow: [../.github/workflows/ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Release template: [../.github/release_template.md](../.github/release_template.md)

## Manual GitHub UI Steps (Not Stored in Repo)

- Create or update GitHub Project board.
- Define milestone dates.
- Configure branch protection rules.
- Configure required status checks.
- Update repository About description, website, and topics.
- Upload social preview image.

## Discoverability-Specific GitHub UI Tasks

- About description should include: `Pashto`, `ASR`, `TTS`, `NLP`, and `machine translation`.
- Topics should include at least: `pashto`, `pukhto`, `pushto`, `asr`, `tts`, `nlp`, `language-resources`.
- Website should point to GitHub Pages search or docs home.
- After renaming the repository, update pinned repositories and profile links.
