# Pashto Language Resources Hub

`pashto-language-resources` is a community-led open-source project focused on making Pashto (also written as Pukhto/Pushto) a first-class language in speech and language AI.

## Mission

- Build open Pashto datasets and resource indexes for ASR, TTS, NLP, and MT.
- Publish reproducible baseline models, benchmark schemas, and evaluation workflows.
- Keep progress transparent, contributor-friendly, and public-benefit oriented.

## What Is In This Repository

- `data/`: dataset workflows, metadata, and normalization seeds.
- `asr/`: ASR baselines and experiment notes.
- `tts/`: TTS baselines and quality tracking.
- `benchmarks/`: benchmark schema, result format, and metric guidance.
- `experiments/`: reproducible run cards and experiment records.
- `docs/`: policies, roadmap, release process, and operating guides.
- `resources/`: verified external Pashto datasets, models, tools, benchmarks, and papers.
